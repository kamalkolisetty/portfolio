## 👋 Welcome to My Digital Universe  

Hey there! I’m **Kamal Kumar Kolisetty**, a passionate **Full-Stack Developer** who loves building elegant, intelligent, and responsive web applications.  

This repository is home to my **personal portfolio** — a living, breathing site powered by the **GitHub API**. It updates automatically as I create new projects and grow as a developer.  

Built from the ground up with **React + Vite**, it’s packed with **smooth animations, interactive effects, and dynamic content**. Every pixel, transition, and motion is carefully crafted to deliver a delightful user experience.

## 🌟 Core Features  

### ⚙️ 1. Dynamic Heartbeat — Powered by the GitHub API  

This isn’t a static site — it’s alive!  
My portfolio dynamically pulls real-time data from GitHub, ensuring it always reflects my latest work.  

- **Auto-Updating Projects:**  
  The “Projects” section fetches all public repositories tagged with `portfolio-project`.  
  Add a new repo or update one on GitHub → it appears instantly on the portfolio.  

- **Smart Resume Link:**  
  The “Resume” button is linked dynamically via the GitHub API.  
  I can change my resume URL in one GitHub file and it updates across the site automatically.

### 🎞️ 2. A Symphony of Motion — Smooth Animations & Interactivity  

Web design should feel alive, not static.  
Every element in this portfolio has been animated with care to make the experience engaging:  

- ✨ **Hero Particles:** Floating visuals powered by CSS `@keyframes` animations — smooth at 60fps.  
- 🪄 **Hover Effects:** Buttons glow, project cards lift subtly, and icons rotate for instant feedback.  
- 🎯 **Scroll Animations:** Using the Intersection Observer API, content slides and fades in gracefully as you scroll.

### 🧩 3. Pixel-Perfect & Fully Responsive  

No matter the screen — mobile, tablet, or 4K display — this portfolio adapts beautifully.  

- 💎 **Responsive Grids:** Flexible layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox.  
- 🔠 **Smart Typography:** Fonts scale perfectly using `clamp()` and viewport units.  
- ⚡ **Optimized Assets:** All images are compressed, lazy-loaded, and retina-ready.
